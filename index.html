<p id="bio">My name is Ariel Kessler and my most favorite thing to do is to play the piano. I have been playing for 12 years and base my whole outside of school life on it. I also love to hang out with my friends and go out with my friends. I am a hard worker in school with a strong work ethic. I also engage in weekly piano theory classes to educate me on the fundmaentals of music. I also love to hang out with my dog Grady who is a four year old Cavapoo. My family owns a piece of the Chicago White Sox, so I grew up as a huge White Sox fan. I go to over 40 White Sox Games a Season, and I am obsessed with following the stats and acheivements of each and every player. In the past year, I fully learned the game of baseball and its history, leading me to have an even stronger passion for the game of baseball. I also love to go to the gym and I watch a lot of Netflix/shows. My favorite show is either Euphoria or The White Lotus. I also love to get nice clothes and go shopping. My favorite stores to shop at are White Fox Boutique, Aritzia, Londo Mondo, and Revolve.  </p>

<p id="bio">Grady is my 4 year old cavapoo who I love very much. He loves to play, go on walks, and run on the beach in the summer. He is also very cuddly and comes in bed with me to cuddle and watch TV with  me. Although he is the sweetest, he is very spoiled and very picky with the treats he likes. Grady is all around the best dog ever and he makes me laugh all the time.  </p>

<p id="bio">Above are some pictures from my seats at Guarantted Rate Field for the Chicago White Sox. My favorite players are Tim Anderson and Luis Robert as they are both clutch hitters with high batting averages. If you know me, you know that I live and breathe the White Sox. I have been going to over 40 games a year since I was born, resulting in an unhealthy obsession with this team. </p>
