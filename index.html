<p id="bio">My name is Ariel Kessler and my most favorite thing to do is to play the piano. I have been playing for 12 years and base my whole outside of school life on it. I also love to hang out with my friends and go out with my friends. I am a hard worker in school with a strong work ethic. I also engage in weekly piano theory classes to educate me on the fundmaentals of music. I also love to hang out with my dog Grady who is a four year old Cavapoo. My family owns a piece of the Chicago White Sox, so I grew up as a huge White Sox fan. I go to over 40 White Sox Games a Season, and I am obsessed with following the stats and acheivements of each and every player. In the past year, I fully learned the game of baseball and its history, leading me to have an even stronger passion for the game of baseball. I also love to go to the gym and I watch a lot of Netflix/shows. My favorite show is either Euphoria or The White Lotus. I also love to get nice clothes and go shopping. My favorite stores to shop at are White Fox Boutique, Aritzia, Londo Mondo, and Revolve.  </p>
